#summary Dev Links

= Introduction =
Post links for useful developer information here.


= SVN Links =
Use these links to do more advanced stuff with SVN. These links show you how to use svn properly through the commandline and do things that tortoise svn does not let you do like branching (which is making a copy of someone else's existing work for yourself) and the proper way to merge (this avoids manual copy paste which also keeps a record of changes).  Please read before doing anything funky with SVN.

= Game Dev Links =
One important link here is the Game State Management sample, which is what our game code base is modeled after.  The Zacharus Engine provides very good extensible design practices for creating games.
